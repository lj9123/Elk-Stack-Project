# Elk-Stack-Project
This is a collection of linux scripts and ansible scripts from my cyberclass. 

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with docker containers. The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DWA containers along with Jumpbox and a server running an Elk stack container.
